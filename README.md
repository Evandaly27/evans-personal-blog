# Evans-Personal-Blog
A personal blog to showcase my thoughts and experiences.

## Description

When the page loads you will be directed to add a username, title, and blog content.
After hitting submit, you will be taking to a page where all the blogs will be stored and can view past blogs. There is a button to change the blog screen from light mode to dark mode. You can also hit the back button to go back to the main page without losing any of your previous blog posts. There is also a button located at the bottom of the blog screen that will take you to my personal portfolio.
